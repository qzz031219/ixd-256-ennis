**Project Name: life's silent escape.**

**Introduction**

This is my initial idea, which is to create an interactive art installation piece. So I want to use the pressure sensor to toggle the videos and use the distance sensor/ultrasonic sensor to control the volume based on the distance between the screen and the audience.


The big concept behind this piece is life. The noise and hustle and bustle of life are everywhere, working and studying, getting up early and going to bed late, all of which take a toll on our minds. Including the seriousness of today's rat race, whether it is society or people around us will bring us a lot of pressure. How do we escape this predicament?


So I want to go through this work to let the audience's mood relax and enter into a meditative state. That's why I want to create an immersive space for this project.



**Implementation**

I used:
- 1 Atom s3 lite board
- 1 Ultrasonic sensor
- 1 Pressure sensor
